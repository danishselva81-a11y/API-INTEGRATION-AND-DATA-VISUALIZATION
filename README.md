# DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:

# ABSTRACT: This project titled “Stock Analyse” is a desktop-based application developed using Python and the Tkinter library to analyze stock market data in a simple and interactive manner. The application allows users to enter a stock symbol and instantly view the current market price using real-time data fetched from Yahoo Finance. It also provides graphical representations such as a one-month price trend chart, a three-month rise and fall pie chart, and a three-year historical price line graph using Matplotlib. In addition to price analysis, the application displays the latest stock market news by integrating the NewsAPI service. This combination of numerical data, visual charts, and news updates helps users better understand market behavior. The system is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for beginners, students, and small investors who want quick insights without using complex trading platforms

# AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project is to develop a simple stock analysis tool. The objectives include fetching real-time stock prices, displaying historical price charts, analyzing price movements over time, and providing the latest stock market news through an easy-to-use graphical interface.

# COMPONENTS AND DESCRIPTION: The project uses several key components. Python is the core programming language. Tkinter is used to design the graphical user interface. yFinance is used to retrieve real-time and historical stock data. Matplotlib is used to generate line charts and pie charts for data visualization. Requests is used to connect to the NewsAPI and fetch the latest stock-related news. Widgets such as buttons, labels, entry boxes, and scrollable text areas help in user interaction. Together, these components create a complete stock analysis application.

# PROCEDURE: First, the required Python libraries are imported. A Tkinter window is created with appropriate styling. The user enters a stock symbol in the input box. When the search button is clicked, the application fetches the current stock price using yFinance and displays it. The chart buttons retrieve historical data and plot graphs using Matplotlib. The pie chart shows the ratio of rise and fall days for three months. The news section fetches recent stock market news using NewsAPI. Error handling is included to manage invalid inputs or network issues.

# RESULT AND DESCRIPTION: The developed application successfully displays real-time stock prices, historical price trends, and market movement analysis in graphical form. Users can clearly understand stock performance through line graphs and pie charts. The inclusion of live news enhances market awareness and decision-making. The interface is visually appealing and easy to navigate. The application responds quickly to user inputs and handles errors gracefully. Overall, the project achieves its goal of simplifying stock market analysis and provides useful insights in a user-friendly manner, making it suitable for educational and basic investment purposes.
